# Project Overview

## Project Description
Adventure Agent is an intelligent adventure planning system built with LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith. It uses a multi-agent architecture to plan mountain bike adventures, bikepacking trips, and outdoor adventures across the US and Canada.

## Architecture
- **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture**: Orchestrator agent manages 14+ specialized agents
- **LangGraph**: StateGraph-based workflow orchestration with conditional routing
- **State Management**: TypedDict-based state schema (`AdventureState`)
- **Text-to-Adventure**: Natural language input processing with LLM-based intent extraction

## Key Components
- **Orchestrator** (`src/agent/agents/orchestrator.py`): Routes requests using LLM analysis and structured output
- **Specialized Agents**: 14+ agents organized by function (geo, trail, weather, permits, safety, etc.)
- **Graph** (`src/agent/graph.py`): Main LangGraph workflow definition
- **State** (`src/agent/state.py`): TypedDict schemas for state management
- **Tools** (`src/agent/tools.py`): 60+ tools for external integrations
- **Config** (`src/agent/config.py`): Environment-based configuration

## Entry Point
- Main graph: `src/agent/graph.py:graph`
- LangGraph config: `langgraph.json`
- Package entry: `src/agent/__init__.py`
