# Project Overview

## Project Description
Arizona Adventure Agentic Workflow is an intelligent adventure planning system built with LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith. It specializes in planning mountain bike adventures, bikepacking trips, and outdoor adventures throughout Arizona. The system uses a multi-agent architecture with location-specific agents for Arizona cities and towns.

## Architecture
- **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture**: Orchestrator agent manages 14+ specialized agents
- **LangGraph**: StateGraph-based workflow orchestration with conditional routing
- **State Management**: TypedDict-based state schema (`AdventureState`)
- **Text-to-Adventure**: Natural language input processing with LLM-based intent extraction

## Key Components
- **Orchestrator** (`src/agent/agents/orchestrator.py`): Routes requests using LLM analysis and structured output
- **Specialized Agents**: 14+ agents organized by function (geo, trail, weather, permits, safety, etc.)
- **Graph** (`src/agent/graph.py`): Main LangGraph workflow definition
- **State** (`src/agent/state.py`): TypedDict schemas for state management
- **Tools** (`src/agent/tools.py`): 60+ tools for external integrations
- **Config** (`src/agent/config.py`): Environment-based configuration

## Entry Point
- Main graph: `src/agent/graph.py:graph`
- LangGraph config: `langgraph.json`
- Package entry: `src/agent/__init__.py`
